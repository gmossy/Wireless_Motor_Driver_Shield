ludusProtoShieldWireless
========

Prototyping shield for quick access to the GPIO pins on an Arduino. 

This is an Arduino shield that integrates an H-Bridge Driver and breaks out 
all I/O ports to three-pin headers on a GND / PWR / SIG standard. This enables quick
prototyping and integration of Arduino projects w/o the need of a breadboard.

This board extends the ludusProtoShield with an XBee header for adding wireless 
capability to your Arduino projects. A switch for SW_Serial ties the TX/RX lines to 
pins A0 and A1 on the Arduino board. 

This shield is a perfect addition to building up a simiple robotics platform with an
Arduino board.

If connected to your Arduino, the switch must be set to SW_Serial in order to program your board.
